repo for pearlhacks brainstorming


some ideas:
- collaborative alt text site -- upload or link to images w/out alt text and someone else can claim and add alt text! requires two people to approve it before it can be "approved" as a correct alt text 
- website that when submitted charts or images, generates color blind friendly color schemes? or lets you know if your image or text is not readable/not color blind friendly
